Complete initial version of design document.

michaelB, shyneC, aryamanG, danielS -- 2022-03-07 18:54
Add images of inspiration game to design document. Clarify what data we will be storing in the database.

michaelB -- 2022-03-08 19:49
Add requirements.txt to the project. Update Flask app by commenting out some code so that it works properly.

aryamanG -- 2022-03-09 08:39
Added login and and register functions/routing

michaelB -- 2022-03-09 08:06
Add basic projectile motion to JS canvas.

michaelB -- 2022-03-09 08:48
Add initial user input launch function, using mousedown and mouseup events.

danielS -- 2022-03-09 20:10
Add level 1 stage assets.
Add gitignore to prevent staging virtual environments & python cache files.

danielS -- 2022-03-09 20:28
Move login & register routes to auth.py.
Streamline login & register logic.

danielS -- 2022-03-09 20:34
Add draw_bg. Change canvas dimensions.

danielS -- 2022-03-10 08:06
Add guest_only decorator to logister routes.

michaelB -- 2022-03-10 17:34
Complete throw function (you can throw the plane now!). Add a game animation loop. Replace placeholder DVD logo with plane placeholder.

michaelB -- 2022-03-10 17:56
Smooth out initial movement by making time start out at 0.5 seconds (as opposed to 0 seconds).

shyneC -- 2022-03-10 18:04
Worked with air resistance equation: the theory should be right, but final dragForce seems too big
DD is updated with new site look

shyneC -- 2022-03-11 08:34
Drag Force is now more reasonable compared with velocity

aryamanG -- 2020-03-11 8:35
Login and Register db functions

michaelB -- 2022-03-11 17:39
Fix projectile motion physics (there was a major bug). Update drag force logic to work with new physics logic. Begin upgrade system.

danielS -- 2022-03-12 21:00
Create landing page layout. Added landing marquee and airplane bop animations.

danielS -- 2022-03-12 21:14
Add button styling.

danielS -- 2022-03-13 17:58
Add login panel.

shyneC -- 2022-03-13 21:23
Add variables and base for speed(ish), crane, throwing, lightweight upgrades. Started calculation of flight stats.

shyneC -- 2022-03-14 08:27

danielS -- 2022-03-14 21:36
Add background motion.

michaelB -- 2022-03-15 08:02
Add rudder system (turning of the plane).

michaelB -- 2022-03-15 12:13
Plane now rotates properly in flight. Fix rudder system (known) bugs.

danielS -- 2022-03-15 16:46
Reorganized script.js into modular javascript files. Added draw.js, game.js, physics.js, throw.js, upgrades.js.
Script.js sets up canvas context & settings. Game.js runs the game.
Update function & variable names to better represent their actual functions.
Update game loop to update offset & plane coordinates on throw.
Split paper airplane image into frames.
Changed canvas and plane dimensions.
Fix page not loading: Images are only drawn after they have been loaded.

danielS -- 2022-03-15 20:33
Fix throwing. Fix rotation.

danielS -- 2022-03-15 21:28
